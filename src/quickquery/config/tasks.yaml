validate_query_task:
  description: >
    Review the SQL query for syntax correctness, security risks (e.g., DROP, DELETE, UPDATE), and performance issues. 
    Ensure it adheres to best practices and is safe to execute against the database without risking data integrity.

    Create a visual representation of the SQL query results using a suitable chart type 
    (e.g., bar chart, line chart, pie chart) based on the data format. The visualization should be clear, 
    concise, and aid in understanding trends, comparisons, or distributions within the data.
